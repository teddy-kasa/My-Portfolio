# my-portfolio
In this weeks homework we were told to create a portfolio (as a webpage) that displays all of our applications and projects. I have created and stylized the design to my liking while making sure to hit all the criteria set. In this project I have learnt how to position content and boxes to where I'd like. I have also learnt how to create a functional nav bar, and clickable pictures. I have added hover effects over the images to give colour on hover. I have made sure to add more comments in my CSS to make it easier to read and follow. In general I enjoyed working on this homework and often got carried away on a lot of little details which would then teach me a lot more different commands and code which I can now use in future work.
